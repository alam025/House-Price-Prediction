House Price Prediction

Overview

This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains various features related to houses (e.g., number of rooms, square footage, location), and the goal is to create a model that accurately predicts house prices based on these features.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, handling missing values, and standardizing the dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing correlations and distributions to gain insights.

Model Training: Using machine learning algorithms to train and test predictive models.

Evaluation Metrics: Assessing model performance using metrics like R-squared and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes features like:

Area: Total square footage of the house.

Bedrooms: Number of bedrooms.

Bathrooms: Number of bathrooms.

Location: Geographic location of the house.

Price: Target variable representing the house price.

Source

The dataset can be found in the data/ directory or sourced from Kaggle.

Requirements

Libraries Used

To run this project, install the following Python libraries:

Numpy: For numerical computations.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Matplotlib: For creating visualizations.

Seaborn: For statistical data visualization.

Scikit-learn: For machine learning and preprocessing.

XGBoost: For building the regression model.

Install the required libraries using:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Workflow

Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values.

Standardized numerical features using StandardScaler.

Exploratory Data Analysis:

Generated heatmaps to understand feature correlations.

Visualized data distributions to detect outliers.

Model Training:

Used the XGBoost Regressor for predictions.

Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

Model Evaluation:

Calculated evaluation metrics like R-squared and MAE.

Usage

Steps to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd house-price-prediction

Run the main script:

python main.py

Results

The final model achieved the following metrics on the test dataset:

R-squared: 0.85

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): $10,000

These results indicate a good balance between accuracy and generalizability.
